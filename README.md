# Global_Vaccination_Tracker

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 vaccination data from various countries and regions around the world in Tableau.
Our aim is to gain valuable insights into the progress and impact of vaccination campaigns, considering factors such as population coverage, vaccination rates, GDP per capita, and the administration of booster doses.

Assessed vaccination coverage by examining the number of people partially and fully vaccinated in each country. I also analyzed the rates of vaccination per hundred individuals in different regions worldwide, enabling a comparative view of vaccination efforts and investigated the correlation between a country's GDP per capita and the progress of its vaccination campaign, shedding light on the influence of economic factors. Furthermore, I explored the administration of daily number of vaccinations and booster doses in different regions, providing insights into the strategies employed to sustain protection against COVID-19.
